# RS485 Isolated Repeater

This project is abotut designing an isolated repeater for RS485 communication. As a person who many times had to deal with RS485 communication, I know how important it is to have a repeater in order to extend the communication distance. However, I also know how important it is to have an isolated repeater in order to avoid ground loops and other issues that can arise from non-isolated repeaters. This project is about designing an isolated repeater that can be used to extend the communication distance of RS485 devices. The repeater is designed to be used with a `12..24V` power supply and can be used to extend the communication distance up to 1000 meters.

To be honest this is not about extending range of RS485 loop, even though it can be used for that. It is about isolating the RS485 devices which are shitty and can cause problems.
